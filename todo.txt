- Box Shadow variable
- border variable?
- Make a reusable card
- Make a reusable modal
- Perhaps make a box component like most other design systems have. I just don't like the idea of extending classes past React.Component.
- Maybe make it so there's an array of values for sizes, etc. to correspond to different screens. 
- What are the goals of our code design standards?
